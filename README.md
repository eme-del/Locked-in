Locked-in a all-round digital platform for productivity: providing users with the slow, unglamorous process that various types of work take, from car manufacturing, writing a 50k novel in a month, undergoing research for a thesis, etc.; offering a conducive environment, tuning their focus on and tracking all their accomplishments against a set goal. 

Locked-in works differently from other social apps, using an algorithm that keeps sessions short and memorable while providing a host of benefits.

## What Does It Do?

It fosters an online space that creates a supply of positive:
* motivation to get into a state to work; and
* lay period in between work sessions.

## Why It Matters?
* Many people view the internet as a world of possibilities, but forget its potential to enhance their productivity.
* Most platforms rarely offer the reality of the work and the wisdom behind it.
* When individuals are more aware of the capacity they carry, they are likely to unleash it.

## Who Is It For?
* Young Adults
* Academicians
* Techies and everyone in between
